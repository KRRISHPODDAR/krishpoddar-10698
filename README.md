# ⚡ Electricity Bill Calculator (C Language)

## 📌 Project Description
The **Electricity Bill Calculator** is a console-based program developed in **C language** that calculates the total electricity bill based on the number of units consumed.  
It follows a **slab-based billing system**, where different unit ranges are charged at different rates.

This project is designed as a beginner-friendly mini project and demonstrates the practical use of conditional statements in C.

## 🎯 Aim of the Project
The aim of this project is to:
- Calculate electricity bills using **slab-wise tariff rates**
- Accept consumer details and unit consumption as input
- Display the final payable amount clearly
- Understand real-world problem solving using C programming

---

## ❓ Why This Project?
- Electricity billing is a **real-life and practical problem**
- Helps in understanding:
  - `if-else` statements
  - User input/output
  - Logical decision making
- Suitable for **Class XII and college-level practicals**
- Easy to explain during viva examinations

## 🧮 Slab-Based Billing Structure (Example)

| Units Consumed | Rate per Unit |
|---------------|---------------|
| 0 – 100       | ₹1.50         |
| 101 – 200     | ₹2.50         |
| Above 200     | ₹4.00         |

*(Slab rates can be modified easily in the source code.)*

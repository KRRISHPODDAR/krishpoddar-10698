# ⚡ Electricity Bill Calculator (C Language)

## 📌 Project Description
The **Electricity Bill Calculator** is a console-based application developed using the **C programming language**.  
It calculates the total electricity bill based on the number of units consumed by a consumer by applying a **slab-based billing system**.

This project is designed as a beginner-friendly mini project and demonstrates the real-world application of conditional statements and arithmetic operations in C.

## 🧮 Slab-Based Billing Structure (Example)

| Units Consumed | Rate per Unit |
|---------------|---------------|
| 0 – 100       | ₹1.50         |
| 101 – 200     | ₹2.50         |
| Above 200     | ₹4.00         |

*(The slab rates can be modified directly in the source code.)*
